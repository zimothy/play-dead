 \section{Introduction}
 
 You are John \emph{``Danger''} Smith. You have awoken in a dark castle with no recollection as to how you got here. You can feel someone watching you, some dark presence with bad intentions. You feel yourself getting sleepy as footsteps approach.
 
 You awaken again to find yourself in a room with nothing except a ladder and a switch and no visible exit. What awaits is a terrifying journey that will damage your very soul.
 
 \section{Controls}
 
 WAS control your movement and E activates switches. The challenge is now making your way through the castle and, hopefully, eventual escape.
 
 \section{Ending}
 
 As you make your way through the castle solving problems, going from room to room, you realise you have no way of escaping. Maybe, if you continue on the dark journey the presence will take pity on you and let you leave.
